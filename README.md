## Black and white chrome extension

This is a chrome extension that changes the colour of the current web page to
black and the text to white when the 'Go monochrome' button in the popup icon is clicked. Clicking on
'Go back' reloads the page to reset the colour changes.

Some websites employ custom templates and so this extension is only able to
target default HTML tags.
